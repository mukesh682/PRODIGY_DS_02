Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Synthetic Dataset
This project is all about getting hands-on with data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using a synthetic dataset I created. The dataset is designed to mimic real-world data, complete with issues like missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and even some outliers. In this project, you'll see how to clean up the data—filling in gaps, removing duplicates, fixing inconsistencies, and dealing with outliers. After that, we'll dive into some EDA to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the data using visualizations and correlation analysis. There’s also a bit of feature engineering to spice things up. This is a practical guide for anyone looking to sharpen their data preprocessing and EDA skills.
